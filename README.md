AR Car Simulator using AI Car in Unity

This project was made to study the capabilities of AR on mobile devices. The project is a simulation of a race track in which an AI controlled car drives around the track at varying pace depending on it's path.

The project was made using the Unity game engine and implemented the use of Vuforia AR kit along with the AI path following car prefab on Unity with slight modifications.
